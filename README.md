# Vermaas Lab Website

This is the website describing our academic research group at Michigan State University.

This website is powered by Jekyll and some Bootstrap, Bootwatch. We tried to make it simple yet adaptable, so that it is easy for you to use it as a template. Plese feel free to copy and modify for your own purposes.  This website was originally forked from the Allan Lab at the University of Leiden [https://github.com/mpa139/allanlab](https://github.com/mpa139/allanlab). You don't have to link to either the Allan or Vermaas labs if you use this in your own websites (but of course we appreciate it).

Go to *aboutwebsite.md*  to learn how to copy and modidy this page for your purpose.
