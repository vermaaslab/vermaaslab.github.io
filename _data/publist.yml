  authors: D Sarkar, L Bu, JE Jakes, JK Zieba, ID Kaufman, MF Crowley, PN Ciesielski, and JV Vermaas
  description: In collaboration with a diverse research group from NREL and the Forest Products Lab, we measured diffusion for ions and cell wall components within models for secondary cell walls at different hydration levels. Unsurprisingly, more water to lubricate the cell wall raises diffusion. However, we predict a moisutre-induced glass transition at around 10-15% water content in secondary plant cell walls.

  authors: S Raza, M Miller, B Hamberger, and JV Vermaas
  description: With this research, we explore how diterpenes permeate across biological membranes. We find that diterpenes permeate passively at large rates across bilayers. Intriguingly, we think that the permeation may be optimized for plant-like membranes.
