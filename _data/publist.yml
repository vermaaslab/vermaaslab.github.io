  description: We developed a new scheme for doing PBC unwrapping, which is correct even for long simulations. We develop code implementations to apply this to <a href=https://github.com/kulkem/qwrap.git>qwrap<\a>, <a href=https://github.com/kulkem/pbctools.git>pbctools<\a>, and fastpbc.

  description: Using experimental Cryo-EM data, we built a better model for the viral vector used in the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. Our collaborators linked its structure to rare blood clotting side effects for the vaccine.
