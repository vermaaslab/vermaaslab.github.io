  news2: Nature has a [companion article](https://healthcommunity.nature.com/posts/huntingtin-s-new-interaction-site-a-tale-of-dnajb1-and-htt-s-proline-rich-domain) that is less technical than a full-blown journal article.

- title: "Exploring cryo-electron microscopy with molecular dynamics"
  authors: JW Vant, D Sarkar, J Nguyen, AT Baker, JV Vermaas, A Singharoy
  description: Together with the Singharoy lab at ASU, we wrote a review on how cryo-EM and MD can be used profitably together.

  authors: M Kulke and JV Vermaas
  description: We developed a new scheme for doing PBC unwrapping, which is correct even for long simulations. We develop code implementations to apply this to [qwrap](https://github.com/kulkem/qwrap.git), [pbctools](https://github.com/kulkem/pbctools.git), and fastpbc.
