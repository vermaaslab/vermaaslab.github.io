  authors: M Kulke, DM Olson, J Huang, DM Kramer, and JV Vermaas
  description: In this paper, we analyze how nanoscale vibrations in a cytochrome nanowire can influence the current carrying ability of these nanowires. Longer than normal distances that electrons need to "hop" create bottlenecks along large chains, which is ameliorated by having a wider wire for electron transfer to take place along.

- title: "Nanoscale simulation of the thylakoid membrane response to extreme temperatures"
  image: pcehighlight.png
  authors: M Kulke, SM Weraduwage, TD Sharkey, and JV Vermaas
  description: This work discusses the dynamic nature of the thylakoid membrane in response to temperature changes and its lipid composition. The study investigates the effects of temperature and isoprene content on the structure and dynamics of the membrane using molecular dynamics simulations. The results suggest that temperature affects various properties of the membrane, while isoprene concentration does not have a significant thermoprotective effect, and isoprene easily permeates the membrane.

  authors: D Sarkar, L Bu, JE Jakes, JK Zieba, ID Kaufman, MF Crowley, PN Ciesielski, and JV Vermaas
  description: In collaboration with a diverse research group from NREL and the Forest Products Lab, we measured diffusion for ions and cell wall components within models for secondary cell walls at different hydration levels. Unsurprisingly, more water to lubricate the cell wall raises diffusion. However, we predict a moisutre-induced glass transition at around 10-15% water content in secondary plant cell walls.

  authors: S Raza, M Miller, B Hamberger, and JV Vermaas
  description: With this research, we explore how diterpenes permeate across biological membranes. We find that diterpenes permeate passively at large rates across bilayers. Intriguingly, we think that the permeation may be optimized for plant-like membranes.
