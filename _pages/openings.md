# Open positions

We are always looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit! We work at the interface of many fields, and so your background is less important to us than your interest in pursuing new paths in computational plant biology!

### Applications for PhD positions
If you are interested in working within the group as a PhD student, please send me an [email](mailto:vermaasj@msu.edu). State briefly why you are interested in working with the group, and note that the typical way for students to apply is through the [Biochemistry](https://bmb.natsci.msu.edu/graduate-program/for-prospective-students/), [Biomolecular Science](https://biomolecular.natsci.msu.edu/applicants/how-to-apply/), or [Plant Biology](https://plantbiology.natsci.msu.edu/graduate-program/application-process/) programs

### Undergraduate Research
If you are a current MSU undergraduate who has interest in the research we do, send me an [email](mailto:vermaasj@msu.edu)! I'd be happy to discuss what kinds of projects we have available that would fit your schedule.
